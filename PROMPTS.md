1. My idea for the agentic application is an agent that can chat with the user to probe their interests, get some URLs that the user would like to get news from, and have the AI handpick relevant and impactful articles (either from the provided news outlets, or probe the internet) for the user to read in a weekly newsletter that is emailed to them. Can you sketch out what the MVP should look like and make a timeline of what features I need to work on? It should be achievable within 2-3 days. 

1. Give me a mental map of what it takes to fulfill each part of the assignment (what technologies/services do what, how they work along with code examples and sketch out a starter directory structure so I can gain a better understanding of all the moving parts I need to set up and connect)

1. Can the worker be in the same repository as the pages application?

1. When I make changes to the worker, do I have to deploy them again to have it reflect in the pages application?

1. Please make a simple frontend form for my application.

1. I've created a secret in my secrets store on my cloudflare dashboard but I cannot access it locally. How do I enable it locally (or make it connect remotely)?

1. Please draft up documentation for my codebase appropriate for a README.md file
